                        <p>CET counseling is the procedure through which qualified candidates are allotted seats in colleges based on their ranks, preferences, and seat availability.
                            The process generally includes:
                                Registration: Candidates register online using their CET number.
                                Document verification: Certificates like marks cards, caste/income certificates, and ID proofs are verified.
                                 Option Entry: Students choose preferred colleges and courses.
                                Seat Allotment: Seats are allotted based on rank, reservation, and options entered.
                                Reporting: Students must confirm their seat by paying fees and reporting to the allotted college..</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>In the Option Entry step, you list your preferred colleges and courses in order of priority.
                          You can enter as many options as you wish, but make sure they reflect your real preferences.
                          The system will allot a seat based on your CET rank and seat availability from your option list.
                          Higher-ranked options (top of your list) are given priority during allotment.
                          Once saved and locked, your options will be used for the next seat allotment round.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>A mock allotment is a trial seat allotment that helps you understand how your options may convert into real seats.
                                 It is conducted before the actual first round of counseling.
                                 The purpose is to show your tentative seat based on your current preferences and CET rank.
                                 After mock results, you can rearrange or modify your options before the final round.
                                 It helps you make smarter, better-informed decisions.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes, you can change your options after the mock round and before the second round of counseling. 
                                However:
                                        You cannot modify options once a round is locked and seat allotment is completed.
                                        If you are satisfied with your first-round seat, you can accept and freeze it.
                                        If not, you can participate in the next round by choosing “Yes” for the next round option.
                                        Make sure to save and lock your new preferences before the deadline.</p>
